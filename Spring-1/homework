Good Design?
Ans:which take less time and requires less cost to change it.
Required things to make good design:
1. can't do it in first  step.
  Do not think that you can make  good design in your first attempt it takes time.
2.having  the ego.
 You should be positive towards your desingn it gives you motivation.
3.be unemotinal.
 
Who are dangerous?
1. Those who dont follow instructions.
2. Those who only follow  instructions.

Always take time to review your design and code.

# KISS: Keep It Simple and Stupid
1.simple keep you focuse.
2.simple  solves only real problems that we know about .
3.simple fails  less. 
4.Simple  is easy to understand.


Complexity of design or code:
1. Inherent: from problem domain.
2.Accidental: when we choose wrong solution for  problem.


A good design is the one that hides inherent  complexity and eliminates the  accidental complexity.

# YAGNI   principle :
( You Are Goona Need It ? )
1. It helps in to postone the features that are costly or  not useful today.


Cohesion:
focussed on doing  one  thing.

Coupling :
What you depends upon .
eg. Inheritance

Note: try to see it you     remove  coupling 


# Knock  Out Before mock Out
Make it loose instead of tight.


Depending class --tight coupling
Depending  interface-- loose coupling.
   

A good design has  high cohesion and low coupling.


# DRY:  Dont Repeat Yourself

Dont  duplicate code and  effort

It reduces cost of development.


Long Methods:
hard to test.
hard to  read.
hard to reuse.
leads to duplicates.
lack cohesion
high coupling

# SLAP Single level of abstraction

try to make  code become comment
  

# OCP  : Open closed Principle
Software should open for  extension but closed for modification.
1. Abstraction and  Polymorphism are the  key to  make  this happen.

Do not overuse inheritance 
It only used for substituability ,
If object of class B use anywhere  object of A then use Inheritance.
If object of B should use an object of A use composition and deligation.

Try not to use Inheritance.
