## Hands On 
* Downloading initial skeleton of project from Spring Initializr. 
* Unzip the downloaded project skeleton in some suitable directory.
* Allowing the dependencies to resolved/downloaded.
* Initialized Git Repo in codebase.
* Created branch [skeleton](https://github.com/geeksmentors/springbootwebapplication/tree/skeleton).
* Created remote/origin on Github for our project codebase.
* Pushed initial branch skeleton to remote(here Github).
* Created and checkout to branch [define_model](https://github.com/geeksmentors/springbootwebapplication/tree/define_model).
* Created Package model.
* Defined Book and Authour model.
* Push define_model to origin.


## Homework 
* Those who're seeing the dependencies in Idea's Maven window with red underlines, it means two things :
    * Either all the dependencies have not been downloaded yet.
    * Idea has not been able to index the downloaded dependencies.
    * Google for it and solve it
    
* Sign up on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
    * Real world web services run on servers which are nothing but some computers present in a company's datacenter.
    * Not all companies can afford to maintain their own datacenters so they rely on public cloud vendors like Amazon Web Services,Microsft Azure,Google Cloud Platform,Digital Ocean etc.
    * These cloud providers provide servers on demand to customers(like us).
    * We'll deploy our web service on AWS servers and test it just like it would have run if you were working for a real production grade system.
* Install MySQL workbench on your system.
   * [Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-installing-windows.html)
   * [Linux](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-linux.html)
   * [MacOsX](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-mac.html)
   * Open it.
   * Run MySQL on your system.
   * Connect to MySQL instance from Workbench.
   * Create a database named `UserData` using Workbench editor.
   * Create a table named `user` in that database with columns (id(PRIMARY KEY),FirstName,LastName) using Workbench editor .
   * Insert some data in `user` table using Workbench editor.
   * Query the data using Workbench editor.
* Learn SQL if you don't know it already from [W3Schools.](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
