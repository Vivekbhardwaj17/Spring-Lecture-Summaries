Outline of contents we covered in the class : 

## Concepts 

* Intro to Git and GitHub 
* Some basic linux commands
* What is a Framework?
* How the Framework is supposed to be used?
* What is Spring?
* What are dependencies of a Project/Application?
* How Maven helps with Dependency Management?
* What are APIs?
* What are Web APIs?
* What are Design Patterns?
* What is Model-View-Controller Design Pattern?
* What are Template Engines, Why they are useful?
* Why Relational Databases are called so?
* What is Server?
* What is Cloud?
* What are examples of public cloud providers?


## Hands On 
* Downloading initial skeleton of project from Spring Initializr. 
* Unzip the downloaded project skeleton in some suitable directory.
* Allowing the dependencies to resolved/downloaded.
* Initialized Git Repo in codebase.
* Created branch [skeleton](https://github.com/geeksmentors/springbootwebapplication/tree/skeleton).
* Created remote/origin on Github for our project codebase.
* Pushed initial branch skeleton to remote(here Github).
* Created and checkout to branch [define_model](https://github.com/geeksmentors/springbootwebapplication/tree/define_model).
* Created Package model.
* Defined Book and Authour model.
* Push define_model to origin.


## Homework 
* Those who're seeing the dependencies in Idea's Maven window with red underlines, it means two things :
    * Either all the dependencies have not been downloaded yet.
    * Idea has not been able to index the downloaded dependencies.
    * Google for it and solve it
    
* Sing up on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
    * Real world web services run on servers which are nothing but some computers present in a company's datacenter.
    * Not all companies can afford to maintain their own datacenters so they rely on public cloud vendors like Amazon Web Services,Microsft Azure,Google Cloud Platform,Digital Ocean etc.
    * These cloud providers provide servers on demand to customers(like us).
    * We'll deploy our web service on AWS servers and test it just like it would have run if you were working for a real production grade system.
